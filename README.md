# Heart-Disease
This is the code for my Heart Disease Prediction Analysis.

Heart disease refers to a range of conditions that might affect an individual’s heart. Diseases under the heart disease heart rhythm problems, coronary artery diseases and other problems. The term heart disease is used interchangeably with the word Coronary Disease which also means the same. Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of mortality in the human population around the world. Prediction of heart disease is considered to be one of the most important topics that is handled by every medical department in the world. 

The need to track these conditions and work on them iteratively continues to grow. The reason that heart disease is one of the major concerns for human deaths should be dealt with.
We have obtained the data for heart disease tracking from one of the most popular dataset repository, i.e., the UCI repository. We wanted to carry out an entire analytics life-cycle on the data. The life-cycle would include us starting off with some basic Exploratory Data Analysis to understand each of the features well.

Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of understanding the features/variables in the data and their correlation with each other. Let’s say we have a dataset on the trait of flowers. This data contains features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width for a variety of flowers. Basic or advanced EDA can help us understand how the species traits for each of the flowers are related to each other. There are numerous use cases of Exploratory Data Analysis. Hence, the need for performing EDA before moving ahead with modeling or prediction is considered an important process
